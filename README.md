# Fundamentals Of C# Programming:  

## .Net Core C# | Collections
A group of objects is represented by a collection in C#, which is also used to perform different operations on objects.

Thus the C# collections perform all the data structure work. Just like an array, a collection can also be used to store objects with an advantage over an array. In a collection, the stored object can grow or shrink dynamically, however, in an array, there is a size limit.
